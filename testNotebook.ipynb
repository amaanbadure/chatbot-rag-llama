The investments that we are making across our businesses, such \\nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services , reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \\nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers . Our \\ninvestments ultimately  may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in \\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations in our products and services could also \\nresult in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends.
